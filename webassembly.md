# WebAssembly

(Wasm) is a binary instruction format that serves as a compilation target for programming languages. It allows code written in languages like C, C++, Rust, and others to be compiled into a binary format that can run in web browsers alongside JavaScript. 

Blazor, on the other hand, is a framework for building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Traditionally, Blazor applications have run on the client-side using WebAssembly, or on the server-side using ASP.NET Core.

When you use WebAssembly in a Blazor application, it means that your C# code is compiled into WebAssembly format, allowing it to execute directly in the browser. This allows developers to build web applications entirely in C# or other supported languages without relying on JavaScript for client-side logic.

Here's how WebAssembly fits into a Blazor application:

1. **Compilation:** Your C# code, along with any required dependencies, is compiled into WebAssembly bytecode. This bytecode is then packaged with your web application.

2. **Client-Side Execution:** When a user accesses your Blazor application in their web browser, the WebAssembly bytecode is downloaded and executed within a secure sandbox directly in the browser.

3. **Interoperability:** Blazor provides mechanisms for interoperability between .NET code running in WebAssembly and JavaScript code. This allows you to seamlessly integrate existing JavaScript libraries or call JavaScript functions from your C# code.

4. **Performance:** WebAssembly offers near-native performance, making Blazor applications fast and responsive even when running complex logic in the browser.

In summary, WebAssembly in a Blazor application enables you to write client-side web applications using C# or other supported languages, leveraging the performance benefits of WebAssembly while enjoying the productivity and familiarity of the .NET ecosystem.
